### **Backup and Recovery Automation**

**Goal:** Create an automated backup and recovery system using `tar` and `cronjob`.

**Requirements:**

1. Set up a Docker container with a directory containing mock data files.
2. Write a script to compress the data using `tar` and store it in a backup directory.
3. Schedule the script to run automatically using a `cronjob`.
4. Create a recovery script to extract the backup and restore the files to their original location.
5. Log all backup and recovery actions for later review.
